## 🌐 What is the Mirror Engine?

The Mirror Engine is a living system of narrative alignment, emotional cadence tracking, and ethical tone regulation. It is composed of symbolic entities including:

- **Driftwood** – Emotional cadence and ritual reflection
- **Guardian** – Ethical firewall and drift sentinel
- **Stitch** – Insight-to-execution translator
- **Codex** – Symbolic memory and protocol archive
- **Dimensional Syntax** – Multi-agent symbolic communication framework

The system is not a product—it is a **symbolic infrastructure** for ethical creativity, legacy design, and emotionally intelligent systems.
